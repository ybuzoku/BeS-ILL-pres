	\begin{defn}[Region]
	  Given a topological space $X$, a region is a non-empty, connected, open subset of $X$. The closure of a region is called a closed region. 
	\end{defn}
	\pause
	For the following definitions, let $f:U\subseteq \mathbb{C} \rightarrow \mathbb{C}$, where $U$ is a region.
	\begin{defn}[Holomorphic]
	A function $f$ is said to be \emph{holomorphic} if it differentiable at all points $z \in U$.

	\begin{itemize}[label={-}]
		\item $\At$ represents a fixed, countably infinite set of propositional atoms. 
		\item Lower case latin letters represent propositional atoms 
		\item Upper case latin letters represent finite multisets of propositional atoms. 
		\item The empty multiset is denoted $\emptymultiset$. 
		\item The sum of two multisets $\at{P}$ and $\at{Q}$ is denoted $\at{P},\at{Q}$. 
		\item Lower case greek letters represent ILL formulas.
		\item Upper case greek letters represent ILL finite multisets thereof. 
		\item Atomic multiset is taken to mean multiset of propositional atoms.

Basic rules take the following form: 
\[\openaddrule (\at{P}_{1_i} \seq \at{q}_{1_i})\closeaddrule^{l_1}_{i=1}, \dots, \openaddrule (\at{P}_{n_i} \seq \at{q}_{n_i})\closeaddrule^{l_n}_{i=1} \Rightarrow \at{r}\]
where 
\begin{itemize}
\item Each $P_i$ is an atomic multiset, called a premiss multiset.
\item Each $q_i$ and $r$ is an atomic proposition.
\item Each $(P_i \seq q_i)$ is a pair $(P_i, q_i)$ called an atomic sequent.
\item Each collection $\openaddrule (\at{P}_{i_1} \seq \at{q}_{i_1}), \dots, (\at{P}_{i_{l_i}} \seq \at{q}_{i_{l_i}})\closeaddrule$ is called an atomic box.

        \[\at{C}_i, \at{P}_{i_j} \deriveBaseM{\baseB} \at{q}_{i_j} \text{ for all } i = 1,\dots, n \text{ and } j = 1,\dots,l_i\]

	\pause

	\pause
	\item Examples of such bases:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item $\baseB = \{ (\Rightarrow p)\}$
		\item $\baseB = \{(\Rightarrow q),\, (q\Rightarrow p) \}$
		%\item $\baseB = \{\at{r},\, \}$ and $\at{L}=\[\at{r}\]$

	Note that if $\at{L}$ were non-empty then all of the atoms in $L$, call them $r_i$, would have to be derivable purely from $\baseB$.
