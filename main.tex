\begin{frame}{Notation}
	\begin{itemize}[label={-}]
		\item $\At$ represents a fixed, countably infinite set of propositional atoms. 
		\item Lower case latin letters represent propositional atoms 
		\item Upper case latin letters represent finite multisets of propositional atoms. 
		\item The empty multiset is denoted $\emptymultiset$. 
		\item The sum of two multisets $\at{P}$ and $\at{Q}$ is denoted $\at{P},\at{Q}$. 
		\item Lower case greek letters represent ILL formulas.
		\item Upper case greek letters represent ILL finite multisets thereof. 
		\item Atomic multiset is taken to mean multiset of propositional atoms.

\begin{definition}
Basic rules take the following form: 
\[\openaddrule (\at{P}_{1_i} \seq \at{q}_{1_i})\closeaddrule^{l_1}_{i=1}, \dots, \openaddrule (\at{P}_{n_i} \seq \at{q}_{n_i})\closeaddrule^{l_n}_{i=1} \Rightarrow \at{r}\]
where 
\begin{itemize}
\item Each $P_i$ is an atomic multiset, called a premiss multiset.
\item Each $q_i$ and $r$ is an atomic proposition.
\item Each $(P_i \seq q_i)$ is a pair $(P_i, q_i)$ called an atomic sequent.
\item Each collection $\openaddrule (\at{P}_{i_1} \seq \at{q}_{i_1}), \dots, (\at{P}_{i_{l_i}} \seq \at{q}_{i_{l_i}})\closeaddrule$ is called an atomic box.

\begin{definition}[Basic derivability relation]
The relation of derivability in a base $\baseB$, is defined inductively as so:
\begin{itemize}
\item[Ref] $p \deriveBaseM{\baseB} p$
\item[App] Given that $(\openaddrule(\at{P}_{1_i} \seq \at{q}_{1_{i}})\Closeaddrule{i=1}{l_1},\dots,\openaddrule(\at{P}_{n_i} \seq \at{q}_{n_{i}}) \Closeaddrule{i=1}{l_n} \Rightarrow \at{r}) \in \baseB$ and atomic multisets $\at{C}_i$ such that the following hold:
        \[\at{C}_i, \at{P}_{i_j} \deriveBaseM{\baseB} \at{q}_{i_j} \text{ for all } i = 1,\dots, n \text{ and } j = 1,\dots,l_i\]

\begin{frame}{Alternative approach}
\begin{center}
\begin{itemize}
\item We want to re-introduce in a controlled manner the ability for multiple and vacuous discharge of hypotheses. 
\pause
\item It is not absurd to distinguish basic sentences based on their content. 
\pause
\item The idea is to define a consequence relation which allows for simultaneous inference from both sentences which are "persistent" and "consumable", thus extending the definition of an basic rule to allow derivations to occur from both collections of sentences.
\item Thus our basic rule might looks something like the following:
